# SMS Notifier

This is a simple app that sends you an email when a call or a SMS is received by your phone.

## Ok, but why?

Let's say that you have a second number and you don't want to carry around two phones.

Yes, you could buy a dual-sim smartphone.

Or you repurpose your old smartphone laying in the shelf for this ;)

You will receive an email for every SMS or call that you'll receive.

It works even with your bank that wants to to use SMS to confirm operations!


# Requirements

- The SSL authentication requires Android 4.4 KitKat. You may however be able to run it on older versions.
- A working wifi or mobile data connection
- A sim to receive the messages and the calls (obviously)
